Smoothed and Unsmoothed Unigrams and Bigram Probabilities Calculation

Smoothing Technique: Good Turing Smoothing

File Names:
    Input:
        a) Corpus: corpus.txt
        b) Input Sentence: inputTokens.txt
        
    Ouput:
        unSmoothedBigrams.py:
            a) unSmoothedUnigrams.txt --> Contains Unsmoothed unigrams probabilites for the whole corpus (N Lines).
            b) unSmoothedBigrams.txt  ->> Contains Unsmoothed bigrams probabilites for the whole corpus (N * N Lines).
        smoothedBigrams.py:
            a) smoothedUnigrams.txt --> Contains smoothed unigrams probabilites for the whole corpus (N Lines).
            b) smoothedBigrams.txt  ->> Contains smoothed bigrams probabilites for the whole corpus (N * N Lines).
                

1) Corpus is tokenized with simple whitespace character(space,\n,\t,).

2) It is assumed that the input sentence is given as each token per line with file name "inputTokens.txt".

3) In smoothing fallowing are assumed:
    a) While calculating c* for some c, if Nc+1=0, the next non zero Ni(i>c+1) value is taken as Nc+1.
    b) For the maximum c, Nc+1 is assumber to be ZERO, hence c* for maximum c will alwasy be zero.
